I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Jun Ma](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/junma) and [Prof. Michael Yu Wang](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/mywang). Prior to my time at HKUST, I earned a Master of Science degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Tongji University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory, robot motion planning, and control. I design algorithms that enable robots to intelligently interact with their surroundings, achieving both high practical performance and rigorous theoretical guarantees through safe and agile motions in complex environments.

During my Ph.D. studies, I have collaborated with [Prof. Xindong Tang](https://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~xdtang/) on the theory and application of moment and polynomial optimization. I also had the opportunity to visit the [Computational Robotics Lab]([Prof. Heng Yang](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard University, where I worked with [Prof. Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/) to develop high-performance numerical solvers for contact-implicit motion planning.
