<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I am jointly supervised by <a href="https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/junma" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Jun Ma</a> and <a href="https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/mywang" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Michael Yu Wang</a>. Prior to my time at HKUST, I earned a Master of Science degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Tongji University.</p> <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory, robot motion planning, and control. I design algorithms that enable robots to intelligently interact with their surroundings, achieving both high practical performance and rigorous theoretical guarantees through safe and agile motions in complex environments.</p> <p>During my Ph.D. studies, I have collaborated with <a href="https://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~xdtang/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Xindong Tang</a> on the theory and application of moment and polynomial optimization. I also had the opportunity to visit the <a href="[Prof.%20Heng%20Yang](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/)">Computational Robotics Lab</a> at Harvard University, where I worked with <a href="https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Heng Yang</a> to develop high-performance numerical solvers for contact-implicit motion planning.</p> </body></html>
